    -- Get the number of stars, first only one star then n stars with a star at either side
    getStars :: String -> Int -> String
    getStars s n
      | n == 0 = s
      | n == 1      = s ++ "*" ++ getStars s (n-1)
      | otherwise   = s ++ "*" ++ getStars s (n-1) ++ "*"

Why the extra string argument? You're only making it difficult for yourself here!

    *Shapes
    ?> putStrLn $ getStars "A" 3
    A*A*A*A**

The extra argument is pasted in-between every star...

Also, the case for `n == 1` is redundant.

Similar for `makeTree`.
